About action pack:

	CA Application Performance Management (CA APM) proactively monitors and provides diagnostic insights into applications across mobile, web, cloud, microservices, containers and mainframe.
	The release-run-remediate process is controlled by CA Continuous Delivery Automation (CA CDA - formerly known as CA Automic Release Automation) with CA APM as a conduit for metadata-enriched telemetry. Meaning more than just using commodity metrics to trigger automations, if there is metadata known at runtime that would be useful to a downstream remediation, that metadata can be attached to the deployed application within CA APM during release, and can be used by CA CDA to trigger a remediation process.
